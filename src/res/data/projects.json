      "summary": "&emsp;The idea to build a drone was a direct extension of my experimentation with microcontrollers (arduino, STM32, Raspberry Pis) around that time.  Plus, as my friend was working for 3DR at the time (when they were still making hardware), I had easy access to fixer uppers.<br/><br/>&emsp;I originally intended to refurbish an octocopter with several blown out motors, but my friend and I were stymied by almost system-wide failures. We decided it would be a better idea to build a quadcopter from the materials we could scrap off of the octocopter, as at least 4 of the motors were still functioning correctly, as was the pixhawk.  We purchased vibration-damping gel to remove some of the vibrations from the motors and also reduced EMI effects with copper plating.  The initial flight occurred in the spring of 2017.",

      "summary": "&emsp;I began this project while staying on Cold Stream Pond in Maine. I've tried my hand before at creating websites, but all of the previous attempts were decidedly old school, primarily featuring a stack of HTML/CSS and vanilla JS, as well as a dash of JQuery to animate things around.  Given that web technology has changed a lot, I decided to give it another go.<br/><br/>&emsp;The website you are on right now is the direct result of that attempt. I used Figma to mock up all my static designs for the website, from my logo to entire pages. I use React.JS as a frontend framework primarily because I like React's design philosophy and it tends to scale quite well, saving me a good amount of work.  One thing I would love to revamp on this website is the way I currently handle CSS. I work with plain old CSS to design everything to my specifications, but it would perhaps be aided by using SCSS instead. I'm also using Redux to store a lot of my application state, and firebase to remotely store some data.  I'm hosting the website through netlify, enabling simple website deployments through the master branch of my git repository. I use Google's Material Design Icons and Material UI to enable many of the icons and transitions throughout this site.",

    "summary": "&emsp;LIDAR Analysis initially came to my attention after scouting for a summer project at the University Of New Hampshire, where a friend of my parent's teaches.  I got set to the task of creating a proof of concept agricultural LIDAR analysis tool. In order to build it, I used VTK, PDAL, PCL, and Qt to build the UI. <br/><br/>&emsp;Probably the best part of learning about LIDAR was its application, which actually surprised me.  I found the metrics used to assess vegetation health fascinating (NDVI, EVI) and came up with many potentially useful applications of this technology.  At the end of my project, I was able to successfully render a LIDAR point cloud in Pseudo-NDVI.  I say Pseudo-NDVI because the test data sets I was working with did not actually have reflectance values, only intensity, and this stymied my ability to get a more accurate read.  However, given reflectance values, I could have calculated true NDVI. In addition, I was able to create auxiliary point cloud map colorings: height and true color.<br/><br/>&emsp;In honesty, I do not believe that I am truly done with this project.  The fascinating nature of the problem, and the effectiveness of the solution continually make me want to revisit this.  Thus, for the time being, I have marked this project as completed, though I believe that I will come back to this, and use the CS skills I know now in order to expand on what I did before, which I am still happy with.<br/><br/>&emsp; I have not included a repository with this project description because I need to go back and see how much of the code is actually there.  At the time, my git skills were limited.  I do not know what code is accounted for.",

    "summary": "&emsp;MEMS Research was actually a part of my english class senior year, which is somewhat ironic because if someone were to think of an english class independent project, Microelectro-mechanical systems (What a mouthful) would probably not be the first thing to come to mind.  But really, I had a blast with this one.  My job at the UC Berkeley SWARM Lab was related to analyzing real time video of MEMS device movement with CV to determine how far it moved.<br/><br/>&emsp;In the end, I used an algorithm called normalized cross correlation which basically analyzes how similar two different sections of an image are. <br/><br/>&emsp;For the UI portion, I used Matlab.  This was probably one of my least favorite parts of te project.  Being a programmer, I found many of Matlab's design decisions to be unintuitive hindrances.  This was compounded by the fact that Matlab runs very slowly, and so it made the task of getting real time video analysis done that much harder. After optimizing with some parallelism using CUDA (I think that's what I used), I was able to raise the frame rate of real time video to 15FPS, which is much better than the 3FPS before. This, done in tandem with my drone refurbishing, helped to stave off my senioritis, and made for a good journal topic.  All in all, I'm very happy I gained some experience with Matlab and CV.",

    "summary": "&emsp;Bruin Map was an example android mobile app that I and some friends hacked together during UCLA Hack on The Hill 2018.  It was a great day.  We started off with zero android development experience, and using android studio, we were able to build the app.  The idea of the app is simple: People want to know what is going on around them as they walk through campus, and further, they want to pass by things that are relevant to them.  So we planned the development of an app that would let a UCLA student do just that, routing them to their classes in an efficient manner, but also giving them notifications when an event of interest was nearby.  On both counts, we used Android's Location API to get the current user location, and then we used Geolocation fences to trigger events that would send messages to the user's phone.  This was implemented in a fairly simple UI.<br/><br/>&emsp;At the end of the day, we won the best mobile app prize.  My fellow hackers were Siddarth Joshi, Baran Yildrim, and Spencer Pugh.  I have marked this project terminated because in a meeting after the hackathon, we determined that the project's scope was too limited, and there were numerous problems from a user engagement standpoint.  All that being said, I still had a good time.",
